# INTERNAL TESTING PHASE:

We need to start testing on various systems.

Please install this repository (`pip install .`) and `numpy`.

Please run: `app/test1.py` and `app/app.py` and post an issue or send to email or slack the output. Please let andrew pikul know if you have done this and it all seems fine.

If everything works, feel free to give `kaleido/app.py` a shot.
