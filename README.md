# Devtools Protocol

`choreographer` allows remote control of browsers from Python.
It is a work in progress:
only Chrome-ish browsers are supported at the moment,
and the name will change before the first release to PyPI.
Note that we strongly recommend using async/await with this package,
but it is not absolutely required.
The synchronous functions described below are intended as building blocks
for other asynchronous strategies that Python may favor over async/await in the future.

## Testers Wanted!

We need your help to test this package on different platforms
and for different use cases.
To get started:

1.  Clone this repository.

1.  Create and activate a Python virtual environment.

1.  Install this repository using `pip install .` or the equivalent.

1.  Run `dtdoctor` and paste the output into an issue in this repository.

## Waitâ€”I Thought This Was Kaleido?

[Kaleido][kaleido] is a cross-platform library for generating static images of plots.
The existing implementation includes a custom build of Chrome,
which has proven very difficult to maintain.
In contrast,
this package uses the Chrome binary on the user's machine
in the same way as testing tools like [Puppeteer][puppeteer];
the next step is to re-implement Kaleido as a layer on top of it.
We can already regenerate all of the existing Kaleido tests:
to do this,
run `kaleido/app.py`.
Please note,
however,
that it takes quite a while,
and will grab focus on your screen as it runs.
Please also note that the version of Kaleido in this repository has some bugs
that have been fixed in the version that will be released.

## Quickstart with `asyncio`

Save the following code to `example-01.py` and run with Python.
(Feel free to choose a more meaningful name for the program.)

```
import asyncio
import choreographer as choreo


async def example():
    browser = await choreo.Browser(headless=False)
    tab = await browser.create_tab("https://google.com")
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
    await tab.send_command("Page.navigate", params={"url": "https://github.com"})
    await asyncio.sleep(3)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(example())
```

Step by step, this example:

1.  Imports the required libraries.
1.  Defines an `async` function
    (because `await` can only be used inside `async` functions).
1.  Asks `choreographer` to create a browser.
    `headless=False` tells it to display the browser on the screen;
    the default is no display.
1.  Wait three seconds for the browser to be created.
1.  Create another tab.
    (Note that users can't rearrange programmatically-generated tabs using the mouse,
    but that's OK: we're not trying to replace testing tools like [Puppeteer][puppeteer].)
1.  Sleep again.
1.  Runs the example function.

See [the devtools reference][devtools-ref] for a list of all possible commands.

### Subscribing to Events

Try adding the following to the example shown above:

```python
    # Callback for printing result
    async def dump_event(response):
        print(str(response))


    # Callback for raising result as error
    async def error_event(response):
        raise Exception(str(response))


    browser.subscribe("Target.targetCrashed", error_event)
    new_tab.subscribe("Page.loadEventFired", dump_event)
    browser.subscribe("Target.*", dump_event) # dumps all "Target" events
    response = await new_tab.subscribe_once("Page.lifecycleEvent")
    # do something with response
    browser.unsubscribe("Target.*")
    # events are always sent to a browser or tab,
    # but the documentation isn't always clear which.
    # Dumping all: `browser.subscribe("*", dump_event)` (on tab too)
    # can be useful (but verbose) for debugging.
```

## Synchronous Use

You can use this library without `asyncio`,

```
my_browser = choreo.Browser() # blocking until open
```

However,
you are responsible for calling `browser.pipe.read_jsons(blocking=True|False)` when necessary
and organizing the results.
`browser.run_output_thread()` will start a second thread that constantly prints all responses from the browser,
but it can't be used with `asyncio` and won't play nice with any other read.
In other words,
unles you're really, really sure you know what you're doing,
use `asyncio`.

### Low-Level Use

We provide a `Browser` and `Tab` interface,
but there is also a lower-level `Target` and `Session` interface that one can use if needed.
We will document these as the API stabilizes.
